Customer Behavior Analytics Project
Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior by exploring purchasing patterns, demographics, subscription status, and other key factors. The aim is to provide actionable insights for business decision-making using Python, SQL, and Power BI. A comprehensive report and presentation have also been created to summarize the findings.

Dataset
Description: The dataset contains customer transactions, demographics, purchase details, product categories, review ratings, subscription status, and other relevant attributes.

Format: CSV/Excel (can be loaded into Python or SQL databases).

Tools & Technologies
Programming & Analysis: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server
Visualization & Dashboard: Power BI
Report & Presentation: Word/Google Docs, Gamma for PPT
Others: Jupyter Notebook

Steps
1: Data Loading:
Load dataset into Python using pandas.
Inspect and understand the structure, types, and basic statistics.

2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze distribution, correlations, and trends.
Visualize key insights using charts and graphs.

3: Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values and duplicates.
Correct inconsistencies in data formats or types.

4: SQL Analysis:
Load the cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.
Write queries to extract insights such as top customers, category-wise sales, purchase trends, and subscription analysis.

5: Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
Build an interactive dashboard showing customer demographics, purchase patterns, subscription status, review ratings, and trend analysis.
Add slicers for dynamic filtering (e.g., gender, category, location).

6: Reporting:
Summarize findings in a clear, structured report.
Highlight actionable insights and recommendations.

Dashboard Features
1: Customer segmentation by age, gender, and location
2: Category-wise sales and purchase trends
3: Subscription and shipping analysis
4:Review rating distribution
5: Interactive filters for dynamic exploration
